(In case you were wondering, that's me! Denny Marcel!)

Math enthusiast with some informal experience in coding. I am passionate with developing programmatic solutions willing to optimize and automate those sorts of processes humans are terribly designed for. The more that part of life is taken care of, the more time we have for those things humans excel. 

Though I am officialy a beginner in the field, my boat is confidently sailing towards becoming a data scientist of sorts. I am currently committed to getting some formal education in the field; for an updated history on how this is going, please visit [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denny-seccon-7168355a/). I love working in R, but am getting acquainted with Python as well.

My intention with this humble page is to showcase the personal projects I managed to bring to life!

### [Black Friday Hackaton](https://dennymarcels.github.io/KDDCup2009/)
IPython Notebook containing the code for my implementation of the [Black Friday Hackaton by Analytics Vidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/black-friday/). The hackaton consisted of implementing a regression model to predict Purchase Amount from customer behavior and demografic information. I took this opportunity to delve a little deeper into the tuning process.

### [Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Cup 2009](https://dennymarcels.github.io/KDDCup2009/)
IPython Notebook having the code for my implementation of the [2009 Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining challenge](https://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup/view/kdd-cup-2009). The challenge comprised implementing a model to classify three behaviors of the clientele, based on a large dataset containing 50,000 instances of 230 variables, of which 190 were numerical and 40 were categorical. The output classes were unbalanced.

### [Flower Species Predictor](https://dennymarcels.github.io/FlowerSpeciesPredictor/)
Code to use a Deep Learning approach to predict flower species from images. The project concerns downloading a pre-trained network, defining and training a classifier on a dataset containing 102 flower species and more than 6,500 images, saving the best-performing model, and using this model to make predictions on new images. This project was originally part of the [PyTorch Scholarship Challenge Nanodegree Program](https://br.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship), developed by Udacity and Facebook and hosted at Udacity.

### [Next Word Predictor](https://dennymarcels.github.io/NextWordPredictor/)
Code to implement a Shiny app consisting of a "next word" predictor, based on a text collection consisting of blogs, news and twitter texts. This project was originally part of the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) course, developed by the Johns Hopkins University and hosted at Coursera.

### [Forex Analysis Shiny](https://dennymarcels.github.io/ForexAnalysisShiny/)
Code to implement a Shiny app that runs a summary of one or more MyFxBook accounts, enabling risk management decisions.
