(In case you were wondering, that's me! Denny Marcel!)

Math enthusiast with some informal experience in coding. I am passionate with developing programmatic solutions willing to optimize and automate those sorts of processes humans are terribly designed for. The more that part of life is taken care of, the more time we have for those things humans excel. 

Though I am officialy a beginner in the field, my boat is confidently sailing towards becoming a data scientist of sorts. I am currently committed to getting some formal education in the field; for an updated history on how this is going, please visit [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denny-seccon-7168355a/). I love working in R, but am getting acquainted with Python as well.

My intention with this humble page is to showcase the personal projects I managed to bring to life!

### [Flower Species Predictor](https://dennymarcels.github.io/FlowerSpeciesPredictor/)
Code to use a Deep Learning approach to predict flower species from images. The project concerns downloading a pre-trained network, defining and training a classifier on a dataset containing 102 flower species and more than 6,500 images, saving the best-performing model, and using this model to make predictions on new images. This project was originally part of the [PyTorch Scholarship Challenge Nanodegree Program](https://br.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship), developed by Udacity and Facebook and hosted at Udacity.

*Created on Dec 18, 2018. Last relevant update on Dec 18, 2018.*

### [Next Word Predictor](https://dennymarcels.github.io/NextWordPredictor/)
Code to implement a Shiny app consisting of a "next word" predictor, based on a text collection consisting of blogs, news and twitter texts. This project was originally part of the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) course, developed by the Johns Hopkins University and hosted at Coursera.

*Created on Oct 19, 2018. Last relevant update on Oct 19, 2018.*

### [Forex Analysis Shiny](https://dennymarcels.github.io/ForexAnalysisShiny/)
Code to implement a Shiny app that runs a summary of one or more MyFxBook accounts, enabling risk management decisions.

*Created on Sep 5, 2018. Last relevant update on Oct 23, 2018.*

### [Mangrove Microbiome Project](https://dennymarcels.github.io/MangroveMicrobiomeProject/)
Code to investigate taxonomic and functional properties of the microbiome of samples of mangrove sediment, by means of next-generation DNA sequencing technology.
