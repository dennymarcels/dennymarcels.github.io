(in case you were wondering, that's me!)

Math enthusiast with some informal expertise in coding. I am passionate with developing programmatic solutions willing to optimize and automate those sorts of processes humans are terribly designed for. The more that part of life is automated, the more time we have for those things humans excel. 

I am currently committed to getting some formal education in the field; for an updated history on how this is going, please visit [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denny-seccon-7168355a/). I love working in R, but am getting acquainted with Python as well.

My intention with this humble page is to showcase the personal projects I managed to bring to life!
