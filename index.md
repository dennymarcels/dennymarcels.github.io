(In case you were wondering, that's me!)

Math enthusiast with informal experience in coding. I am passionate with developing programmatic solutions willing to optimize and automate those sorts of processes humans are terribly designed for. The more that part of life is taken care of, the more time we have for those things humans excel. 

Though I am officialy a beginner in the field, my boat is confidently sailing towards becoming a data scientist of sorts. I am currently committed to getting some formal education in the field; for an updated history on how this is going, please visit [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denny-seccon-7168355a/). I love working in R, but am getting acquainted with Python as well.

My intention with this humble page is to showcase the personal projects I managed to bring to life!

### News classification (NLP Project)
This implementation is confidential. In this project, I relied on [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) [Portuguese](https://github.com/neuralmind-ai/portuguese-bert) to train a model to classify news articles into one of ten possible categories. The dataset was built from scratch using webscraping library [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) (I still wonder where that name came from). The trained model was containerized using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and turned into a web tool using [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine). A prototype can be check [here](http://34.70.152.92:5000/). A txt file containing one news text in Portuguese must be supplied. I suggest getting a news article from [El Pa√≠s Brasil](https://brasil.elpais.com/) since the categories are expected to match.

### [Instacart Market Basket Analysis](https://dennymarcels.github.io/InstacartBasketAnalysis/)
IPython Notebook containing my implementation of the apriori algorithm to determine association rules based on the dataset included in a [Kaggle competition that goes by the same name](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis). The data consists of over 3 million orders in a grocery store, indexed by user. The orders contain product information and timestamp.

### [Northeastern SMILE Lab - Recognizing Faces in the Wild](https://dennymarcels.github.io/AreTheseTwoPeopleRelated/)
IPython Notebook containing code for my approach to the [Can you determine if two individuals are related?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recognizing-faces-in-the-wild) Kaggle challenge. The dataset contains face photos of individuals grouped by family. The objective is to determine from the photos if two individuals are genetically related.

### [FIFA 2019 Complete Player Dataset](https://dennymarcels.github.io/FIFA2019CompletePlayerDataset/)
IPython Notebook containing code for the exploration of the [FIFA 2019 Complete Player Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19). This dataset contains several attributes for all 18k+ FIFA soccer players. I used the technical features, and some physical features of the athletes, to group them in technical profiles. Then I investigated how these profiles were related to the players's actual positions in the field.

### [NYC Taxi Fare Prediction](https://dennymarcels.github.io/NYCTaxiFarePrediction/)
IPython Notebook containing code for my implementation of the [NYC Taxi Fare Prediction challenge from Kaggle](kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction). This dataset contains loooots of instances for taxi rides, along with features depicting time, pickup/dropoff coordinates and number of passengers. I spent most of my energy on data exploration, data cleaning and feature engineering. It was one of the most fun datasets I worked with this far.

### [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone](https://dennymarcels.github.io/HumanActivityRecognition/)
IPython Notebook containing code for my implementation of the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The dataset contains features derived from movement measured by the accelerometer and gyroscope of a smartphone while volunteers were performing six activities. There are 10299 instances and 561 features for this classification problem. I took this opportunity to explore the Scikit-Learn documentation, first on the supervised learning methods, then on the best-performing model for the tuning process.

### [Black Friday Hackaton](https://dennymarcels.github.io/BlackFridayHackaton/)
IPython Notebook containing code for my implementation of the [Black Friday Hackaton by Analytics Vidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/black-friday/). The hackaton consisted of implementing a regression model to predict Purchase Amount from customer behavior and demografic information. I took this opportunity to delve a little deeper into the tuning process.

### [Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Cup 2009](https://dennymarcels.github.io/KDDCup2009/)
IPython Notebook having code for my implementation of the [2009 Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining challenge](https://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup/view/kdd-cup-2009). The challenge comprised implementing a model to classify three behaviors of the clientele, based on a large dataset containing 50,000 instances of 230 variables, of which 190 were numerical and 40 were categorical. The output classes were unbalanced.

### [Flower Species Predictor](https://dennymarcels.github.io/FlowerSpeciesPredictor/)
Code to use a Deep Learning approach to predict flower species from images. The project concerns downloading a pre-trained network, defining and training a classifier on a dataset containing 102 flower species and more than 6,500 images, saving the best-performing model, and using this model to make predictions on new images. This project was originally part of the [PyTorch Scholarship Challenge Nanodegree Program](https://br.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship), developed by Udacity and Facebook and hosted at Udacity.

### [Next Word Predictor](https://dennymarcels.github.io/NextWordPredictor/)
Code to implement a Shiny app consisting of a "next word" predictor, based on a text collection consisting of blogs, news and twitter texts. This project was originally part of the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) course, developed by the Johns Hopkins University and hosted at Coursera.
